# CGS-Client

The ```cgs-client``` container instantiates a web server (<http://localhost:port>) which exposes a REST API so that the [Clean Room Az CLI extension](../../tools/azure-cli-extension/cleanroom/README.md) and [CGS PS cmdlets](../../../samples/governance/scripts/) can create/update contracts, propose and vote on contracts and get events related to a clean room execution.
